# Cannabis AI Risk Heatmap (Executive View)

This artifact prioritizes AI risks in regulated retail environments using an
Impact × Likelihood framework, with emphasis on compliance, surveillance ethics,
and public trust.

## High Impact / High Likelihood
- Biased or inaccurate ID and age verification outcomes
- Disparate impact in access control or enforcement decisions
- Inadequate consent for biometric or surveillance data use

## High Impact / Medium Likelihood
- Opaque AI-assisted enforcement without explanation
- Vendor-controlled models with limited audit access

## Medium Impact / High Likelihood
- Model drift in surveillance and anomaly detection systems
- Over-collection or retention of sensitive customer data

## Low Impact / Low Likelihood
- Non-material forecasting or inventory optimization errors (monitored)
