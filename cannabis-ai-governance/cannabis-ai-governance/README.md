# Cannabis & Regulated Retail AI Governance

Responsible AI Governance framework focused on AI use in highly regulated
retail environments, with emphasis on compliance, enforcement risk,
and public trust.

This project examines how AI systems should be governed when they influence
access control, surveillance, compliance monitoring, and customer eligibility.
