Governance-Aware AI Product Evaluation Framework
Feasibility · Risk · Value (FRV) Model

Kwame Thomas | Responsible AI & Governance

Executive Summary

This project presents a governance-aware framework for evaluating artificial intelligence (AI) product proposals before deployment. It is designed to ensure that AI systems are not only technically feasible, but also responsible, trustworthy, compliant, and genuinely valuable to end users.

The framework operationalizes Responsible AI by evaluating AI use cases through three integrated lenses:

Feasibility → Risk → Value (FRV)

This approach supports transparent, defensible, and user-centered AI product decisions, particularly in education and other public-interest or regulated domains.

Problem Statement

Organizations often evaluate AI initiatives primarily through:

Technical feasibility

Cost and speed

Competitive or market pressure

This leads to:

Deployment of AI systems that are technically functional but socially harmful

Governance controls applied too late in the lifecycle

Misalignment between AI capabilities and real user needs

Erosion of trust among educators, users, and regulators

This project addresses that gap by embedding AI governance directly into product decision-making.

Framework Overview: The FRV Model

The FRV Model ensures that AI proposals are evaluated holistically — not just by what AI can do, but by what it should do and whether it actually helps.

1️⃣ Feasibility — Can We Build This Responsibly?

Feasibility goes beyond technical performance. It evaluates whether an AI system can be built and operated without creating governance debt.

Key Evaluation Questions

Is the data lawful, high-quality, and appropriate for the intended use?

Can the model’s outputs be meaningfully explained to affected users?

Can humans oversee, override, or contest AI-supported decisions?

Are third-party vendors transparent and auditable?

Is operational ownership clearly defined?

Governance Principle

An AI system is not feasible if it cannot be explained, governed, or held accountable.

2️⃣ Risk — Should We Deploy This AI?

Risk assessment evaluates the potential for harm, not just likelihood of failure. Risk is contextual and varies by domain and population.

Risk Dimensions Considered

Bias and disparate impact

Privacy and data protection

Transparency and explainability gaps

Model drift and misuse

Regulatory, legal, and reputational exposure

Governance Principle

What is acceptable risk in one context may be unacceptable in another.

3️⃣ Value — Does This AI Actually Help?

Value is defined by real-world impact, not feature sophistication. AI systems that users do not trust or adopt do not deliver value.

Value Indicators

Improves decision quality or consistency

Reduces cognitive or administrative burden

Aligns with real educator workflows

Enhances outcomes without removing human judgment

Is understood and trusted by users

Governance Principle

AI that lacks trust, clarity, or adoption does not create value.

Governance-Aware Product Decision Process

Each AI proposal is reviewed using a structured, repeatable governance process:

Use Case Intake

FRV Evaluation (Feasibility, Risk, Value)

Human Oversight Design

Transparency & Disclosure Review

Decision Outcome

Approve

Approve with conditions

Redesign

Reject

Monitoring & Reassessment Plan

This process ensures that trust, compliance, and usability are treated as first-class product requirements.

Cross-Functional Collaboration Model

Responsible AI governance requires collaboration across disciplines.

Key Stakeholders

Educators and practitioners (user reality)

Product and design teams (usability)

Data and engineering teams (technical constraints)

Legal and compliance partners (regulatory exposure)

Leadership (risk appetite and accountability)

Outcome
AI capabilities are aligned to real educator needs, not hype-driven assumptions.

Example Use Case Evaluation (Illustrative)

Proposed AI:
Student risk prediction system for early intervention

FRV Assessment

Feasibility: ⚠️ Data limitations, limited explainability

Risk: 🔴 High bias and labeling risk

Value: 🟡 Limited trust from educators

Governance Decision
❌ Reject as designed
✔ Reframe as decision-support tool with:

Human review

Transparency to educators

Clear appeal and override mechanisms

Governance Outcome

Harm prevented

Trust preserved

Educational integrity maintained

Governance Outcomes Enabled by This Framework

Organizations using this framework can confidently state:

AI use cases are evaluated before deployment

High-risk AI systems receive heightened oversight

Human accountability is preserved

Compliance is proactive, not reactive

AI decisions are explainable and contestable

Product value is grounded in user trust

What This Project Demonstrates

This project demonstrates the ability to:

Evaluate AI beyond technical feasibility

Apply governance at the decision-making level

Translate Responsible AI principles into practice

Align AI products with real user needs

Support compliant, trusted, and usable AI systems

Think and operate as a Responsible AI leader

Positioning Statement

Responsible AI is not a policy exercise — it is a product decision discipline.

This framework shows how AI governance can guide what gets built, how it is deployed, and whether it should exist at all.
