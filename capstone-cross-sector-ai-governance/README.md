# Cross-Sector AI Governance Capstone

## Unified Responsible AI Operating Model
**Kwame Thomas | Responsible AI & Governance**

---

## Purpose

This capstone synthesizes Responsible AI governance principles across
multiple regulated and public-interest domains, including:

- Residential real estate
- Education systems
- Regulated retail / cannabis

It demonstrates how organizations can move from fragmented AI controls
to a **cohesive, enterprise-level AI governance operating model**.

---

## Core Thesis

AI governance must be:
- **Risk-based**, not one-size-fits-all
- **Context-aware**, not purely technical
- **Operational**, not aspirational

This capstone shows how AI risk, accountability, and oversight can be
consistently applied across sectors while respecting domain-specific
regulatory requirements.

## Governance Model Components

### 1. Unified AI Risk Taxonomy
A shared framework for identifying and prioritizing AI risks such as:
- Bias and disparate impact
- Privacy and data misuse
- Opaque or unexplainable decisions
- Model drift and vendor risk

---

### 2. Lifecycle Governance Controls
AI systems are governed across their full lifecycle:
- Design and data sourcing
- Deployment and decision support
- Monitoring and audit
- Retirement and decommissioning

---

### 3. Human Accountability Framework
Across all sectors:
- AI supports decisions — humans own outcomes
- High-impact decisions retain human review
- Clear escalation and appeal paths exist

---

### 4. Sector-Specific Tailoring
While the governance core is shared, controls are tailored for:
- Fair housing obligations (real estate)
- Student protections (education)
- Compliance and enforcement risk (regulated retail)

---

## Capstone Artifacts (In Development)

- Cross-sector AI risk heatmap
- Enterprise AI governance lifecycle diagram
- 90-day AI governance implementation playbook

---

## Outcome

This capstone demonstrates the ability to:
- Design AI governance at enterprise scale
- Align Responsible AI with legal, ethical, and operational realities
- Support executives, regulators, and technical teams with a shared model
