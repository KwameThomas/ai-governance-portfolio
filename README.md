# Responsible AI & AI Governance Portfolio
## Kwame Thomas | Responsible AI & Governance

This repository contains executive-level AI Governance projects focused on
regulated, high-risk, and public-interest domains.

Each project demonstrates how Responsible AI is operationalized through
risk assessment, governance frameworks, human accountability, and compliance
alignment.
